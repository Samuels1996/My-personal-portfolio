            <p>
           My name is Brian Samuels. I am an entry level software developer. I was born in Alpharetta, GA. Some of my hobbies include hunting, fishing, as well as computer gaming.
           I decided in December of 2021 that I wanted to go through the Georgia Tech Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. The experience has been extremely rewarding and I am very excited to start on this new path of software development.
            </p>
            <p>
            My dream career is become either a lead software developer or a senior software engineer. I know this this will be a journey to get to those goal marks but I am ready for the challenges that will be coming.
